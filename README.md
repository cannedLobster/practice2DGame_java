# practice2DGame_java
2D game engine built from Java. Project started with the intention to practice Java and learn how to code visual entities.

This is a compilation of code that I coded from using various sources online on coding a game using Java. This engine
uses a simple tile system along with North West South East scrolling directions.

This project is not meant to be utilized. It's purpose is to be used for practice and exploring.
