# practice2DGame_java
2D game engine built from Java. Project started with the intention to practice Java and learn how to code visual entities.

This is a compilation of code that I coded from using various sources online on coding a game using Java. This engine
uses a simple tile system along with North West South East scrolling directions. The game runs at a capped 120 frames per second with 60 ticks. The game can be customized to have custom scaling and mapping. A walking animation can be implemented on the character as well. There is a main menu with full mouse control. The main character will interact with objects on the map that has collision, resulting in the inability to move through the object. Projectile animation is also implemented but not yet utilized.

This project is not meant to be utilized. It's purpose is to be used for practice and exploring.
